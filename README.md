# Clueless-Clothing-Closet
This program demonstrates a reference to the famous dress-up scene from the movie "Clueless." The program gets you to refer to the type of season the user wants to dress in, as well as choose which shirt and pants/skirt/shorts the user prefers. Accessories and Shoes were not included as the user could choose from hundreds and hundreds of varieties of different choices. Finally, the program takes the user's choices and outputs them to their chosen outfit. It includes friendly and interactive messages along the way, encouraging the user on their valued clothing choices :)  Instructions for running the project: 1. Click 'Run' on your PyCharm 2. Follow the instructions on the first window to choose your season 3. Once that is done, it prompts the user to 'proceed in picking out their clothes' which pressing 'Enter' means for you to return to the first window to continue with the game. 4. Follow the rest of the choices and it should give your outfit based on your choices!
